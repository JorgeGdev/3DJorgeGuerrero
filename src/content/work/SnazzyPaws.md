<h3>Snazzy Paws Grooming</h3>
This project showcases the application of advanced web development concepts, focusing on security, performance, deployment, and content delivery techniques. All development decisions were guided by best practices and industry standards while aligning with the assessment marking schedule.

<h3>Project Description</h3>
**Snazzy Paws Grooming** is a fictional dog grooming business with two locations in Hamilton, New Zealand. The website promotes the business, showcases their services and facilities, allows users to book appointments, and features interactive animations and a secure staff-only page.

The design emphasizes accessibility, responsive layout, good UX/UI, and semantic HTML5 with appropriate use of Bootstrap and CSS..

<h3>The website feature</h3>
Throughout the design process, careful attention was paid to accessibility, responsiveness, and compliance with legal requirements. The website features custom-built pages that respect user privacy and clearly communicate policies, while also supporting internal operations through staff-only sections, protected with JavaScript logic due to hosting limitations, yet designed in alignment with professional security principles. 

<h3>Security and data integrity</h3>
Security and data integrity were also at the heart of the project. A layered understanding of confidentiality, authenticity, and utility informed every elemen. From how user data is collected and stored, to how content is curated and managed. The end result is a digital solution that inspires trust, respects users, and safeguards content while remaining visually appealing and professionally presented. 

From a technical perspective, the site was optimized for performance and maintainability. Decisions on hosting, SSL certification, and CDN services were based on current market offerings, cost-efficiency, and scalability, culminating in a deployment strategy that balances performance with practical constraints. These considerations were supported by in-depth research, visual comparisons, and clear documentation.
